# ML-Custom-AI

**ML-Custom-AI** is a Python project that aims to recreate the core concepts and functionalities of **Scikit-Learn**, including its machine learning algorithms, preprocessing utilities, model selection mechanisms, metrics, and transformers.  
Rather than cloning Scikit-Learn directly, this project reimplements these ideas using a different approach — to better understand *how* and *why* these components work under the hood.

## Project Overview

The **goal** of this project is to:
- Deepen my understanding of how machine learning algorithms and libraries function internally.
- Strengthen and sharpen my programming and algorithmic problem-solving skills.
- Learn version control and GitHub collaboration while building a portfolio of meaningful AI/ML projects.

This project serves as a **personal exploration** of building a modular, extensible ML framework that mirrors the design philosophy of Scikit-Learn but is built completely from scratch.

## Features (In Progress)

The project will include implementations of:
- **Supervised Learning Algorithms**
  - Linear Regression
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Trees
  - k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- **Preprocessing Tools**
  - Encoders
  - Scalers
  - Imputers
- **Model Selection Utilities**
  - Train-test split
  - Cross-validation
- **Metrics**
  - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, MSE, R², etc.
- **Transformers**
  - Custom pipeline-compatible data transformers

> Each module is designed to be reusable and flexible, making experimentation and debugging easier while keeping the structure close to modern ML library design.

## Learning Objectives

This project is not meant to compete with Scikit-Learn — it’s meant to:
1. Build a **deeper conceptual understanding** of machine learning internals.
2. Develop **stronger coding discipline** through structured, modular, and testable code.
3. Improve **version control proficiency** with Git and GitHub workflows.
4. Populate my GitHub with **educational and practical AI projects** for future reference and career use.

## Disclaimer:

I am choosing to disclose that I have used Artificial Intelligence in making of this project, however, the uses are stricly
limited to the following:

1. Generation of Numpy-style documentation
2. Clarification of library function uses and the conceptual understanding of the code that I wrote
3. Assistance in debugging and tracing errors
4. Generating the model's code for testing and benchmarking

The said use cases are only limited to what is said above. <br>
Rest assured that all of the AI's responses, especially generated code, were heavily reviewed <br>
before being approved.

Lastly, the core decisions and implementations of the machine learning models were and still are written by me to make sure I still understand the core logic of the machine learning models.
